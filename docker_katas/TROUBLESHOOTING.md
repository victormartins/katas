# Troubleshooting

## Can't Acces the dockerized WebService
- Make sure we binded the server ip to 0.0.0.0 in the Dockerfile
  eg:
  ```
  CMD ["bundle", "exec", "rackup", "-o", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "8080"]
  ```
  For Rails we have to use the -b option:
  ```
  CMD ["bin/rails", "s", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
  ```
- Make sure docker-compose exposes the port of the webserver insider docker to the outside world
    Eg: Mapping the default port of Rack `8080` to my host machine `9001`
    ```
    ports:
      - 9001:8080
    ```
## Ruby Logs Don't show in Docker Logs
By default, Ruby buffers output to stdout, which doesnâ€™t play well with Docker Compose.
To fix this we need to add the following command:
```
$stdout.sync = true

```
In rails this typically goes to the top of `config/boot.rb`.
I also saw that this works when set inside `config.ru`
